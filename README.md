# Sublime-Text2-MVBasic-Syntax

This is my custom syntax highlighting/indentation/sinppets for OpenQM and D3 Basic. This will (currently) work well with most versions of Basic for MV systems. I've also included some preferences that help with MV syntax (especially allowing "." as part of a variable name). Even with that I've noticed that Sublime doesn't 100% support this setting with goto definition. The syntax definitions are case insensitive, however, the snippet tab completions are not (I've defined them in lowercase). 

If you have better soultions please contribute to this! This is my first crack at customizing Sublime.
