# Sublime-Text2-OpenQM-Syntax

This is my custom syntax highlighting/indentation/sinppets for OpenQM Basic. This will (currently) work well with most 
versions of Basic for MV systems. QM has a lot of extra keywords copmpared to other MV systems but deleting them from 
qm-basic.tmLanguage should be pretty easy. I'm not a Sublime guru so my definitions are simple. I used AAAPackageDev 
to write the main syntax definition in YAML which was converted to XML (via AAAPackageDev). I wrote all this for 
Sublime Text 2, other versions are probably not compatable with this unless there's a converter.

If you have better soultions please contribute to this! This is my first crack at customizing Sublime.
