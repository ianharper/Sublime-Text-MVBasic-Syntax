# Sublime-Text2-MVBasic-Syntax

This is my custom syntax highlighting/indentation/sinppets for OpenQM Basic. This will (currently) work well with most 
versions of Basic for MV systems. QM has a lot of extra keywords copmpared to other MV systems but deleting them from 
qm-basic.tmLanguage should be pretty easy. I'm not a Sublime guru so my definitions are simple. I used AAAPackageDev 
to write the main syntax definition in YAML which was converted to XML (via AAAPackageDev). 

If you have better soultions please contribute to this! This is my first crack at customizing Sublime.
